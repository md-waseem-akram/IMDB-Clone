# IMDB-Clone

This Front End Skill test from Coding Ninjas where we had to make a mini IMDB Clone app using only Vanilla JavaScript.
I have used OMDB API: https://www.omdbapi.com/ to fetch movies.

Below are the Features of this App;

=> Home Page
1. Search any movie from the API and display the search results on the frontend
2. Each search result of the movie has a favourite button, clicking on which the movie will be added to â€œFavourite List"
3. On clicking any particular search result (any movie), Movie detailes page will be opened with more information about that movie.

=> Movie Page
1. It will show information about the movie like its name, photo, plot, etc

=> My favourite movies Page
1. It will display a list of all the favourite movies.
2. I have made this list persistent that means it will have the same number of movies before and after closing the browser/refreshing the browser.
3. A Remove button is provided to remove from favourites list, Also I have added clear list button which will remove all content from List.

Thank you Coding Ninjas for giving me this opportunity.
